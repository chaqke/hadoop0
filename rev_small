10061->|->|Approved->|If you've only ever used cloth mouspads then you are in for a shock - a few minutes using the Allsop Metal Art pad is enough to realise that cloth is dead and metal is in!The pad is very well designed - it's not too ugly and will blend in with your system (no "comedy" image is a plus too!), it's also very sturdy (which you would expect from a metal pad) and won't flex or bend during use.Tracking is exceptionally accurate due to the quality materials used, and the fine slightly textured finish which both optical and ball mice will love.I recently upgraded to a laser mouse and coupled with the metal art pad it really is a fantasticaly accurate combination.  The mouse glides over the hard surface very smoothly and the tracking is perfect.I whole-heartedly recommend this pad not only to gamers but also for any computer user who has ever looked accusingly at his mouse as it mis-tracked or failed to respond to your movements - it won't happen when you use this pad.  :)->|10030->|Charcoal Metal Art Mouse Pad->|Allsop

10130->|->|Approved->|I grew up with the Kirby vacuum cleaner.  Some sales rep came by and demonstrated (back in the early 80's) how much dirt it could pick up off of our couch.  Since then, nothing really came close to Kirby quality until I ran into this Dyson.  This thing is really powerful, and picks up even larger objects easily.  Plus, there's a carrying handle that is placed in just the right place so it's easy to carry around (up and down stairs in my case).  And of course, the fact that you can see all the dirt you pick up is quite satisfying.I do have two gripes though: cleaning it is not that intuitive, because I feel like I have to force the cartridge out, and then force it in.  I wonder if and when the little plastic piece that helps hold the dirt cartridge in will break.  So far so good, but I've only emptied it about 4 times.  My other gripe is that Dyson should have a light on the vacuum so that you can better see what you're picking up (and what you're not picking up).  Overall though, I think it's a great vacuum that does the job, especially on the cat hair that is constantly floating around my house.->|10289->|All Floors->|MoreHome

10135->|->|Approved->|Danger!!I took my new pack on an ice climbing trip to the Alps. The pack felt great. It felt well balanced, light and comfortable. Accessibility was not a problem. One afternoon on a 1.5hr walk- out from a climb, when we finally reached the car, to my dismay I found that the strapping that reverse feeds through the buckles that secures the top lid, the crampons and the bottom of my ice ax had all come loose. I lost one quit expensive ice ax as it slid out of the ice ax tube. My crampons where hanging precariously off the back of the pack and my rope was very loose under the removable top lid. It was a tough walk out with lots of jostling but I have hiked many years through all types of terrain. This was a first. I checked the routing of the strap through the buckles. They were all correct. I contacted the manufacturer in Jackson NH and informed him about this and advised him to replace the straps with a more course weave or get diffent buckles and also to ask him to reimburse me for the cost of one grivel ice ax. Although he was sympathetic, he was unwilling to do so. I was able to return the pack and get a refund which gave me some satisfaction. It's a shame that such a nice pack has such a serious design flaw.->|10299->|Chernobyl->|Mountain Gear

10139->|->|Approved->|A helmet is a necessity for all snowboarders, even if you're not doing tricks.  Some people won't wear them because they're uncomfortable or they don't look good.  This helmet solves both of those problems.  It has good venting on top, so your head won't overheat.  4 of the vents are adjustable, and they really seem to work well.  The chinstrap is easy to adjust, and the padding makes it extremely comfortable under the chin.  This helmet also has a strap at the back that will help hold your goggles in place.  This creates a snug fit that keeps your face warm and your visibility good.This helmet also fits under the hood of my snowboarding jacket, which helps keep me warm on the coldest days.  It's a great value, and I'd recommend it to anyone.->|10309->|Skycap - Men&apos;s->|Mountain Gear

Cleaning was also easy because of the removable plates -- much better than the original Foreman grills, which got food stuck in weird nooks and crannies.The downside to this grill is its construction: the plastic seems to crack easily.

It's great for playing in the snow and keeping warm during walks in even the most bitter conditions I've encountered. However, this jacket is not tailored to fit a women's body like some other models, and if you are petite like me, even though it doesn't feel too puffy, it might look too puffy for your size. At the same time, the elastic at the sleeves is too tight and constricting for my taste.There is one good-sized internal pocket, but I wish it had more internal pockets like some other models (for cell phones, MP3 players, etc.)The hood fits well, but it is not detachable and sometimes feels as though it's in the way.Overall, this is a warm, well-made jacket that could use some extra pockets and a more "woman friendly" fit.->|10326->|Hooded Nuptse Jacket - Women&apos;s Fall 2006->|Mountain Gear

To date, January 4, 2006, after many calls to your company, the only information I am ever given is that the item will be shipped when you receive it from Marmot.  I would never order from Mountain Gear again. I do not feel their service is honest or reputable from my experience.

10228->|->|Approved->|I did a lot of research on CD storage cases before I bought this product. I went to severaI stores and examined many other brands. None of the units in stores met my specs, so I went on line and found these Allsop units and bought 4 of them. Most CD storage units are padded. I didn't want padded units, since I stack them on a shelf, and the padding wastes space. Most CD storage units won't stand up on their own on a shelf. These are great. Not only do they stand up, they fit next together tightly, with no wasted space. I'll admit that these were also on sale when I bought them, which was another attractive feature. The bottom line is that I recommend these units highly. So why didn't I give them the highest rating? Its because there doesn't seem to be an elegant way to label them. The external case is just bare aluminum. I finally decided to use stickers on the spine. It will be a bit messy when it comes time to re-label them again. But that's not a big deal.There's one other potential problem that isn't particular only to this brand. That is, that when you place a CD in the case, or remove one, you must be very careful not to accidently drag the surface of the CD against the bare metal corner edges of the case. Other brands have this same problem as well. I can see that if someone is in a bit of a hurry, or tries to do this on their moving car, they could easily scratch a disk.but overall - great job Allsop!->|10038->|Aluminum CD Album 64->|Allsop
