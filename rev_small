10061->|->|Approved->|If you've only ever used cloth mouspads then you are in for a shock - a few minutes using the Allsop Metal Art pad is enough to realise that cloth is dead and metal is in! The pad is very well designed - it's not too ugly and will blend in with your system (no "comedy" image is a plus too!), it's also very sturdy (which you would expect from a metal pad) and won't flex or bend during use. Tracking is exceptionally accurate due to the quality materials used, and the fine slightly textured finish which both optical and ball mice will love.I recently upgraded to a laser mouse and coupled with the metal art pad it really is a fantasticaly accurate combination.  The mouse glides over the hard surface very smoothly and the tracking is perfect.I whole-heartedly recommend this pad not only to gamers but also for any computer user who has ever looked accusingly at his mouse as it mis-tracked or failed to respond to your movements - it won't happen when you use this pad.  :)->|10030->|Charcoal Metal Art Mouse Pad->|Allsop

10130->|->|Approved->|I grew up with the Kirby vacuum cleaner.  Some sales rep came by and demonstrated (back in the early 80's) how much dirt it could pick up off of our couch.  Since then, nothing really came close to Kirby quality until I ran into this Dyson.  This thing is really powerful, and picks up even larger objects easily.  Plus, there's a carrying handle that is placed in just the right place so it's easy to carry around (up and down stairs in my case).  And of course, the fact that you can see all the dirt you pick up is quite satisfying.I do have two gripes though: cleaning it is not that intuitive, because I feel like I have to force the cartridge out, and then force it in.  I wonder if and when the little plastic piece that helps hold the dirt cartridge in will break.  So far so good, but I've only emptied it about 4 times.  My other gripe is that Dyson should have a light on the vacuum so that you can better see what you're picking up (and what you're not picking up).  Overall though, I think it's a great vacuum that does the job, especially on the cat hair that is constantly floating around my house.->|10289->|All Floors->|MoreHome

10133->|->|Approved->|These underwear are incredibly durable. Although more expensive than other underwear they last forever. The elastic doesn't break. The colors stay bright (I wash mine in hot water everytime). I've stopped buying boxers at the Gap and just get them from Patagonia. All they need now is a line of boxers that glow in the dark.->|10293->|Silkweight Capilene Boxers - Men&apos;s->|Mountain Gear
10134->|->|Approved->|When you can't get white gas, this stove is your best friend. Most foreign countries sell the camping Gaz canisters which are environmentally wasteful. This stove allows you to backpack and travel without carting around and disposing of those canisters. Now getting any camping gear on an airplane these days....well, that's the trick I guess. I've used this product in the Chilean and Argentinian Patagonia, the Sierra Nevada mountains in California and Easter Island off the coast of Chile.->|10212->|WhisperLite International 600 Stove->|Mountain Gear
